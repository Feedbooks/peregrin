Speaking</a>, <em>Dale Breckenridge Carnegie</em></p>
<p>Training in public speaking is not a matter of
externals--primarily; it is not a matter of
imitation--fundamentally; it is not a matter of conformity to
standards--at all. Public speaking is public utterance, public
issuance, of the man himself; therefore the first thing both in
time and in importance is that the man should be and think and feel
things that are worthy of being given forth. Unless there be
something of value within, no tricks of training can ever make of
the talker anything more than a machine--albeit a highly perfected
machine--for the delivery of other men's goods. So self-development
is fundamental in our plan.</p>

<em>Sun Tzu</em></p>
<p>The Art of War is a Chinese military treatise that was written
during the 6th century BC by Sun Tzu. Composed of 13 chapters, each
of which is devoted to one aspect of warfare, it has long been
praised as the definitive work on military strategies and tactics
of its time.<br />
The Art of War is one of the oldest books on military strategy in
the world. It is the first and one of the most successful works on
strategy and has had a huge influence on Eastern and Western
military thinking, business tactics, and beyond. Sun Tzu was the
first to recognize the importance of positioning in strategy and
that position is affected both by objective conditions in the
physical environment and the subjective opinions of competitive
actors in that environment. He taught that strategy was not
planning in the sense of working through a to-do list, but rather
that it requires quick and appropriate responses to changing
conditions. Planning works in a controlled environment, but in a
competitive environment,</p>

Sutra</a>, <em>Vatsyayana</em></p>
<p>The Kama Sutra, is an ancient Indian text widely considered to
be the standard work on human sexual behavior in Sanskrit
literature written by the Indian scholar Vatsyayana. A portion of
the work consists of practical advice on sex. Kāma means sensual or
sexual pleasure, and sūtra are the guidlines of yoga, the word
itself means thread in Sanskrit.<br />
The Kama Sutra is the oldest and most notable of a group of texts
known generically as Kama Shastra). Traditionally, the first
transmission of Kama Shastra or "Discipline of Kama" is attributed
to Nandi the sacred bull, Shiva's doorkeeper, who was moved to
sacred utterance by overhearing the lovemaking of the god and his
wife Parvati and later recorded his utterances for the benefit of
mankind.</p>

of Benjamin Button</a>, <em>Francis Scott Fitzgerald</em></p>
<p>This story was inspired by a remark of Mark Twain's to the
effect that it was a pity that the best part of life came at the
beginning and the worst part at the end. By trying the experiment
upon only one man in a perfectly normal world I have scarcely given
his idea a fair trial. Several weeks after completing it, I
discovered an almost identical plot in Samuel Butler's
"Note-books."<br />
The story was published in "Collier's" last summer and provoked
this startling letter from an anonymous admirer in
Cincinnati:<br />
"Sir--<br />
I have read the story Benjamin Button in Colliers and I wish to say
that as a short story writer you would make a good lunatic I have
seen many peices of cheese in my life but of all the peices of
cheese I have ever seen you are the biggest peice. I hate to waste
a peice of stationary on you but I will."</p>

Papers</a>, <em>Publius</em></p>
<p>The Federalist Papers are a series of 85 articles advocating the
ratification of the United States Constitution. Seventy-seven of
the essays were published serially in The Independent Journal and
The New York Packet between October 1787 and August 1788. A
compilation of these and eight others, called The Federalist, was
published in 1788 by J. and A. McLean.<br />
The Federalist Papers serve as a primary source for interpretation
of the Constitution, as they outline the philosophy and motivation
of the proposed system of government. The authors of the Federalist
Papers wanted to both influence the vote in favor of ratification
and shape future interpretations of the Constitution. According to
historian Richard B. Morris, they are an "incomparable exposition
of the Constitution, a classic in political science unsurpassed in
both breadth and depth by the product of any later American
writer."</p>

<em>Ayn Rand</em></p>
<p>Anthem is a dystopian fiction novella by Ayn Rand, first
published in 1938. It takes place at some unspecified future date
when mankind has entered another dark age as a result of the evils
of irrationality and collectivism and the weaknesses of socialistic
thinking and economics. Technological advancement is now carefully
planned (when it is allowed to occur at all) and the concept of
individuality has been eliminated (for example, the word "I" has
disappeared from the language). As is common in her work, Rand
draws a clear distinction between the "socialist/communal" values
of equality and brotherhood and the "productive/capitalist" values
of achievement and individuality.<br />
Many of the novella's core themes, such as the struggle between
individualism and collectivism, are echoed in Rand's later books,
such as The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. However, the style of
"Anthem" is unique among Rand's work, more narrative-centered and
economical, lacking the intense didactic expressions of
philosophical abstraction that occur in later works. It is probably
her most accessible work.</p>
