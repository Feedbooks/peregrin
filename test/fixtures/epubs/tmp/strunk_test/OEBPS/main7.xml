<h3 class="section_title">7. A participial phrase at the beginning
of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject.</h3>
<div class="text">
<blockquote>
<p>Walking slowly down the road, he saw a woman accompanied by two
children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word&#xA0;<em>walking</em>&#xA0;refers to the subject of the
sentence, not to the woman. If the writer wishes to make it refer
to the woman, he must recast the sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He saw a woman, accompanied by two children, walking slowly down
the road.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Participial phrases preceded by a conjunction or by a
preposition, nouns in apposition, adjectives, and adjective phrases
come under the same rule if they begin the sentence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On arriving in Chicago, his friends met him at the
station.<br />
When he arrived in Chicago, his friends met him at the station.</p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p>A soldier of proved valor, they entrusted him with the defence
of the city.<br />
A soldier of proved valor, he was entrusted with the defence of the
city.</p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p>Young and inexperienced, the task seemed easy to me.<br />
Young and inexperienced, I thought the task easy.</p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p>Without a friend to counsel him, the temptation proved
irresistible.<br />
Without a friend to counsel him, he found the temptation
irresistible.&#xA0;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sentences violating this rule are often ludicrous.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being in a dilapidated condition, I was able to buy the house
very cheap.</p>
